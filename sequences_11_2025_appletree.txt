# Appletree Outbound Email Sequences

## A-TIER CAMPAIGN
**Target:** ServiceTitan/Jobber/HousecallPro users + high reviews (20-30 points)
**Strategy:** Tech + scale sophistication play
**Sequence:** 4 emails over 14 days

---

### Email 1 (Day 0)
**Subject:** {{first_name}} - tax season question

{{first_name}},

How responsive is your CPA during busy season?

Most HVAC owners running {{service_software}} tell us the same thing: They can't get their accountant on the phone during tax season, then April hits and there's a surprise $15k bill.

You're clearly running a tight operation at {{company}} ({{review_count}} reviews doesn't happen by accident). But if your accounting feels like a black hole, we should talk.

We're Appletree Business Services. We specialize in trades at your scale — monthly books, proactive tax planning, fixed pricing. No surprises.

Worth a conversation? [Calendly link]

### Email 2 (Day 4)
**Subject:** Re: Quick question about {{company}}'s accounting

{{first_name}},

Following up about {{company}}'s accounting.

You're running {{service_software}}, so you clearly have your operations dialed in. But here's the pattern we see constantly with HVAC companies at your scale:

→ CPA goes MIA during busy season
→ Books are 3 months behind
→ April brings surprise tax bills

Sound familiar?

We handle bookkeeping, payroll, and strategic tax planning for growing HVAC companies. Fixed monthly price, proactive communication, 24-hour response time.

If your current CPA setup isn't working, let's talk: [Calendly link]

### Email 3 (Day 9)
**Subject:** Your tech stack vs. your CPA

{{first_name}},

You're running {{service_software}}. That's a $10k+/year investment in doing things right.

But let me guess — your CPA still wants to chat "once things calm down" and sends you a bill you weren't expecting.

We work with HVAC companies that have outgrown the local accountant who only shows up in March.

What we do differently:
→ Monthly books (not once-a-year scrambles)
→ Proactive tax planning (not surprise bills)
→ Fixed pricing (no hourly billing mysteries)
→ 24-hour response time (not radio silence)

Companies like {{company}} deserve financial systems as dialed in as their operations.

Open to a quick call?

### Email 4 (Day 14)
**Subject:** Last note about {{company}}

{{first_name}},

Last email, I promise.

{{company}} has {{review_count}} reviews and you're running {{service_software}}. You're clearly doing things right.

If your accounting is the only part of your business that still feels chaotic — unresponsive CPA, messy books, tax surprises — we should talk.

We're Appletree. We clean up the financial side so you can focus on running jobs.

If now's not the time, no worries. But if it is, here's my calendar: [Calendly link]

Following up about {{company}}'s accounting.

**Common pattern with HVAC companies at your scale:**

**Subject:** {{first_name}} - following up from November

{{first_name}},

Reached out in November about {{company}}'s accounting. You were slammed with heating season (totally get it).

Now that things have calmed down: still planning to stick with your current CPA for 2026, or open to a conversation?

Most HVAC owners we work with switched because their accountant was MIA during tax season and they got hit with surprise bills.

If you want to start 2026 with better accounting, here's my calendar: [link]

**Key Messaging Principles:**
1. Pain points first (unresponsive CPA, surprise bills) - NOT sophistication/better financials
2. Conversational, owner-to-owner tone
3. No accounting jargon
4. Use trades language (jobs, busy season, etc.)
5. Short, scannable emails
6. Clear value prop in every email
7. Direct questions, not clever hooks

**Success Metrics to Track:**
- Open rates by tier (does scoring matter?)
- Reply rates by tier
- Personal email vs catchall email performance gap
- Pain point resonance (which gets more replies: unresponsive CPA vs tax surprises)
- "Talk to me in January" replies (build pipeline)
- Meeting bookings by tier

**Realistic Q4 Expectations:**
- Personal emails (85): 3-5 replies, 1-2 meetings
- Catchall emails (65): 1-2 replies, 0-1 meetings
- Total: 4-7 replies, 1-3 meetings by end of December
- Most replies will be "talk to me in January" - this is expected and good
